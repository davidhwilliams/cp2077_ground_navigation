# In-World Navigation

[![](https://byob.yarr.is/jackhumbert/in_world_navigation/cp_version)](https://github.com/jackhumbert/in_world_navigation/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

This mod displays in-world holographic arrows for quest/point of interest navigation, mirroring the dots in the minimap. They're currently displayed all of the time, but will eventually be configurable.

## Bugs

If you come across something that doesn't work quite right, or interferes with another mod, [search for or create an issue!](https://github.com/jackhumbert/in_world_navigation/issues) I have a lot of things on a private TODO list still, but can start to move things to Github issues.
